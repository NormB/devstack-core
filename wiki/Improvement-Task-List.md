### Task 1.5: Document Container Privileged Capabilities

**Priority:** Critical 🔴
**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours (was 1h, +100% for comprehensive docs)
**Impact:** Medium - Security transparency and awareness

**Current Issue:**
- Vault uses `IPC_LOCK` capability without explanation
- cAdvisor uses `SYS_ADMIN` and `SYS_PTRACE` without justification
- Files: `docker-compose.yml:752-753`, `docker-compose.yml:1492-1494`
- No audit trail of privileged capabilities

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Subtask 1.5.1:** Add inline documentation to docker-compose.yml
   - [ ] Find Vault service definition (around line 752)
   - [ ] Document Vault IPC_LOCK capability:
     ```yaml
     cap_add:
       # IPC_LOCK: Required for Vault's mlock() to prevent secrets from being swapped to disk
       # Security trade-off: Acceptable in dev, use encrypted swap in production
       # Alternative: Run Vault with 'disable_mlock = true' (not recommended)
       - IPC_LOCK
     ```
   - [ ] Find cAdvisor service definition (around line 1492)
   - [ ] Document cAdvisor SYS_ADMIN capability:
     ```yaml
     cap_add:
       # SYS_ADMIN: Required for cAdvisor to access container metrics via cgroups
       # Security trade-off: SYS_ADMIN is nearly equivalent to --privileged
       # Production alternative: Use Prometheus node-exporter with restricted permissions
       - SYS_ADMIN
       # SYS_PTRACE: Required for cAdvisor to inspect process information
       # Security trade-off: Allows debugging and inspection of other containers
       - SYS_PTRACE
     ```
   - [ ] Add security notes section at top of docker-compose.yml
   - **Test:** Review comments for clarity and accuracy
   - **Test:** `docker compose config` still validates

2. **Subtask 1.5.2:** Update SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md
   - [ ] Add "Privileged Container Capabilities" section

   - [ ] For each container, list added capabilities (cap_add)
   - [ ] For each container, list dropped capabilities (cap_drop)
   - [ ] Generate security report with risk assessment
   - [ ] Output format: table with container name, capabilities, risk level
   - [ ] Exit code 0 if only known capabilities, 1 if unexpected
   - [ ] Add to test suite
   - **Test:** Run script and verify output
   - **Test:** Script detects if new capability added

4. **Subtask 1.5.4:** Update container security best practices

   - [ ] Document capability alternatives (e.g., node-exporter vs. cAdvisor)
   - [ ] Add capability approval process (document why before adding)
   - [ ] Add links to Docker security documentation
   - [ ] Add capability quick reference (what each does)
   - **Test:** Documentation review
   - **Test:** Best practices are actionable

5. **Subtask 1.5.5:** Add capability check to CI/CD
   - [ ] Update `.github/workflows/security.yml` (if exists)

   - **Test:** Whitelist works correctly

6. **Subtask 1.5.6:** Integration testing
   - [ ] Run audit script: `./scripts/audit-capabilities.sh`
   - [ ] Verify report shows Vault (IPC_LOCK) and cAdvisor (SYS_ADMIN, SYS_PTRACE)
   - [ ] Verify no unexpected capabilities
   - [ ] Verify risk levels are reasonable
   - [ ] Review SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md for completeness
   - **Test:** Audit script passes
   - **Test:** No security regressions

**Documentation Example:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - Security Notes
# This file uses minimal privileged capabilities for development.
# For production deployment:
#   - Consider alternatives that don't require elevated privileges
#   - Use encrypted swap instead of IPC_LOCK for Vault
#   - Use Prometheus node-exporter instead of cAdvisor
#   - Document and approve all capabilities in security review

vault:
  cap_add:
    # IPC_LOCK: Prevents memory paging to disk (keeps secrets in RAM)
    # Why needed: Vault mlock() calls require this capability
    # Risk: Low - only affects Vault process memory
    # Production: Use encrypted swap and disable_mlock = true
    - IPC_LOCK
```

**Post-Task Validation:**
- [ ] Audit script passes: `./scripts/audit-capabilities.sh`
- [ ] Documentation complete: All 3 capabilities documented
- [ ] No new capabilities added unknowingly
- [ ] CI check added (or documented for future)

### Task 2.5: Add Integration Tests to CI/CD

**Priority:** High 🟠
**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 12 hours (was 4h, +200% for Docker-in-Docker complexity)
**Impact:** Medium - Catch integration issues before merge

**Decision Required:** Choose implementation strategy (see below)

**Implementation Steps:**

**Option A: Comprehensive Integration Tests (12 hours)**

1. **Subtask 2.5.1:** Research CI/CD Docker options
   - [ ] Evaluate Docker-in-Docker (DinD) approach
   - [ ] Evaluate GitHub Actions service containers
   - [ ] Evaluate testcontainers library
   - [ ] Test Colima/Docker Desktop alternatives for CI
   - [ ] Select best approach for project
   - [ ] Document decision with pros/cons
   - **Test:** Decision documented in ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

2. **Subtask 2.5.2:** Create integration test workflow
   - [ ] Create `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`
   - [ ] Set up Docker environment (DinD service or Docker socket mount)
   - [ ] Install dependencies (docker-compose, python, uv)
   - [ ] Configure test environment variables
   - [ ] Set resource limits for CI (avoid timeout)
   - **Test:** Workflow syntax valid: `gh workflow view integration-tests.yml`

3. **Subtask 2.5.3:** Implement test execution in CI
   - [ ] Start services with minimal profile: `./devstack start --profile minimal`
   - [ ] Wait for services to be healthy (poll health endpoints)
   - [ ] Run subset of tests (fastest, most critical)
   - [ ] Run `./tests/test-vault.sh`
   - [ ] Collect test results and logs
   - [ ] Generate test report
   - [ ] Stop services and cleanup
   - **Test:** Workflow runs manually (on: workflow_dispatch)

4. **Subtask 2.5.4:** Add test result reporting
   - [ ] Upload test results as GitHub artifacts
   - [ ] Add test summary to job summary (GitHub Actions feature)
   - [ ] Set workflow status based on test results
   - [ ] Add comment to PR with test results (optional)
   - **Test:** Test results visible in GitHub UI

5. **Subtask 2.5.5:** Optimize test execution time
   - [ ] Implement Docker layer caching
   - [ ] Parallelize independent tests (if possible)
   - [ ] Use minimal profile for faster startup
   - [ ] Skip long-running tests in CI (run manually)
   - [ ] Target: Complete in <15 minutes
   - **Test:** Workflow completes in acceptable time

6. **Subtask 2.5.6:** Integration testing
   - [ ] Trigger workflow manually: `gh workflow run integration-tests.yml`
   - [ ] Verify all tests run
   - [ ] Verify test results reported
   - [ ] Test failure handling (introduce failing test)
   - [ ] Verify workflow fails on test failure
   - **Test:** CI/CD integration tests pass

7. **Subtask 2.5.7:** Documentation
   - [ ] Update `docs/TESTING_APPROACH.md`
   - [ ] Document CI/CD test execution
   - [ ] Document which tests run in CI vs. manual
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for CI failures
   - **Test:** Documentation review

**Option B: Lightweight Testing (4 hours - Recommended)**

If Docker-in-Docker proves too complex, use this simpler approach:

1. **Subtask 2.5.1:** Create lightweight validation workflow
   - [ ] Create `.github/workflows/validation.yml`
   - [ ] Run shellcheck on all bash scripts
   - [ ] Run python linting (ruff, mypy)
   - [ ] Validate docker-compose.yml syntax
   - [ ] Validate all YAML files
   - [ ] Run unit tests (no Docker required)
   - **Test:** Workflow runs and passes

2. **Subtask 2.5.2:** Document manual integration testing
   - [ ] Create `docs/MANUAL_INTEGRATION_TESTING.md`
   - [ ] Document pre-merge checklist
   - [ ] Require manual test run before merge
   - [ ] Document in CONTRIBUTING.md
   - **Test:** Documentation clear and actionable

3. **Subtask 2.5.3:** Defer full integration testing to Phase 5
   - [ ] Add to Phase 5 backlog (future work)
   - [ ] Document as known limitation
   - [ ] Revisit when more time available
   - **Test:** Decision documented

**Recommended Choice:** Option B (Lightweight Testing)
**Rationale:** Docker-in-Docker for Colima + Vault is complex and may not be feasible in GitHub Actions. Focus on what's achievable now, defer complex integration to future phase.

**Post-Task Validation:**
- [ ] CI workflow exists and runs
- [ ] Tests provide value (catch real issues)
- [ ] Documentation complete
